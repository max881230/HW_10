# SimpleSwap
Implement a **Simple AMM Swap** contract with a **0% fee** ratio in `contracts/SimpleSwap.sol`. Ensure that you **override all the external functions defined in `ISimpleSwap.sol`**, and that the implementation passes all the tests.

It is recommended to first read the NatSpec documentation in `ISimpleSwap.sol` before implementing the contract. If there are any uncertainties regarding the function's purpose or implementation, feel free to discuss them in the Discord channel.
